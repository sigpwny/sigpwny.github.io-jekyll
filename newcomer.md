Welcome to SIGPwny! We are so glad that you found us, and we hope you are ready to start hacking! Outlined here some resources to get you started.


1. Join our discord here, at [sigpwny.com/discord]({{ site.discord_link }}) to talk with members of the club. Once you are there, read `#rules` and `#announcements` for any recent info.

2. Flip through this [presentation](https://sigpwny.github.io/presentation-content/FA2021/01-tutorial.pdf) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwYNdxmAn8w)!


Our second meeting of the year will generally be "[Setting Up](https://sigpwny.github.io/presentation-content/FA2021/00-settingup.pdf)". 
If you're joining us after that, please learn what a shell is and make sure you have a bash one on your computer.


Here are some other learning resources for getting started:
