# SIGPwny Sponsorship Information

## whois SIGPwny
SIGPwny, the computer security club at UIUC, is the largest ACM special interest group on campus with over 400 registered members. We teach computer security and emphasize the adversarial mindset, training our members to think outside the box and tackle challenges in designing secure software, hardware, and anything in between.

## What We Offer
We have a number of awesome events that will allow you to take advantage of our reach!

### Fall CTF
At the beginning of every school year, we run [Fall CTF](https://fallctf.sigpwny.com/) which is a one-day hacking competition that runs in person at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We have hosted Fall CTF since 2019, and our 2022 event was our most successful yet â€”over 300 students from UIUC competed, most being computer science and engineering majors! We want to make Fall CTF 2023 bigger and better and we can't do this without the support from companies like yours. By sponsoring this event, you will get access to competitor resumes and have the opportunity to present and have your very own booth in the same room as the competition. More information about all the ways your company can get involved can be found on our [Fall CTF Sponsorship Sheet](https://sigpwny.com/fall).

### UIUCTF
Every summer we also run [UIUCTF](https://uiuc.tf/) which is one of the largest academic security CTF competitions, with 1,000+ teams and 2,000+ players from the global cybersecurity community competing last year. SIGPwny, the computer security club at UIUC, is seeking sponsors to help run our next event. Your company can get involved in a number of ways, from resumes and challenges to having virtual representatives in the competition Discord and presenting at the closing ceremony. More information about UIUCTF and how to get involved can be found on our [UIUCTF Sponsorship Sheet](https://sigpwny.com/uiuctf).
