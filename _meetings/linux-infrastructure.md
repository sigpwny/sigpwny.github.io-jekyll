This meeting is centered around some challenges made for Grimm's Hax 2018 CTF. The challenges build on a wide array of essential and commonly used tools in both pwning as well as general linux use. Atendees will get a good feel for crontab, grep, find, ps, and much more. The highlight of these challenges is a pretty cool sequence of privilege escalations, as well as a neat custom shell escape.
